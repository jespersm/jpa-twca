# JPA Tripwire

Tools for inspecting JPA/Hibernate models and databases to detect potential performance issues. Once burned twice shy.

## Overview

I built the JPA Tripwire to help developers identify common database performance issues rooted in the leaking abstraction that is an O/R Mapper.
 The tool analyzes your entity classes and the actual database schema to find discrepancies that can lead to slow queries and performance degradation:

- N+1 selects due to missing fetch graphs or general belief in magic
- Missing indexes on foreign key columns
- Missing indexes on unique constraint columns
- Tables without primary keys
- Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
- Suboptimal composite indexes

## How to

### Use Unselectinator in a Spring Boot integration test

`unselectinator-hibernate` contains configuration beans to enable capturing lazy loads.

The main entry point is [`UnselectinatorSpringConfiguration`](unselectinator-hibernate/src/main/java/io/github/jespersm/jpa/tripwire/unselectinator/hibernate/spring/UnselectinatorSpringConfiguration.java), and with that, you can wrap observations in an [`Unselectinator`](unselectinator-core/src/main/java/io/github/jespersm/jpa/tripwire/unselectinator/core/Unselectinator.java), which registers the required instrumentation (using  [`EntityLoadTracker`](unselectinator-core/src/main/java/io/github/jespersm/jpa/tripwire/unselectinator/core/EntityLoadTracker.java), [`ObservedEntityManagerFactory`](unselectinator-core/src/main/java/io/github/jespersm/jpa/tripwire/unselectinator/core/ObservedEntityManagerFactory.java) and [`RepositoryFetchObservationAspect`](unselectinator-hibernate/src/main/java/io/github/jespersm/jpa/tripwire/unselectinator/hibernate/spring/RepositoryFetchObservationAspect.java)). 

Nothing activates automatically, so each test class opts in explicitly. Example:

```java
@SpringBootTest(classes = MyApp.class)
@Import(UnselectinatorSpringConfiguration.class)
class MyIntegrationTest {
    ...

    @Test
    @Transactional
    void testThingWorksWell() {
        var report = unselectinator.observe(() -> {
                var aThing = thingRepository.findByFrobKind("xyz");
                assertTrue(aThing.thingWorks());
        });
        assertEquals(0, report.getLazySelectCount(), "Expected that things could work without lazy loads");
    }
    ...
}    
```

You can also put the reference into a shared test base class:

```java
@SpringBootTest(classes = { MyApp.class, UnselectinatorSpringConfiguration.class })
abstract class AbstractMyTest { }
```

See [`UnselectinatorIntegrationTest`](jpa-tripwire-test-parent/src/test/java/io/github/jespersm/jpa/tripwire/test/UnselectinatorIntegrationTest.java) for a working example.

The library provides a tracker-based interceptor that detects N+1 select patterns at runtime by monitoring Entity Manager loads and Spring Data repository method executions and the resulting SQL statements.
Wraps repository methods and tracks entity loads to identify when multiple queries are issued for related entities, indicating potential N+1 issues. Currently only supports Hibernate as a JPA provider.

### Use Indexinator to assert your database structure matches expected query behavior

After running [`Indexinator`](indexinator-core/src/main/java/io/github/jespersm/jpa/tripwire/indexinator/core/Indexinator.java) and getting an [`InspectionReport`](indexinator-core/src/main/java/io/github/jespersm/jpa/tripwire/indexinator/core/model/InspectionReport.java), assert that there are no findings:

```java
try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()) {
    InspectionReport report = Indexinator.builder()
           .withEntities(ThingLibrary.class, Thing.class, ThingAttribute.class)
           .withRepositories(ThingLibraryRepository.class, ThingRepository.class)
           .build()
           .inspect(connection);
    assertFalse(report.hasIssues(), "Expected no index findings for things in libraries.");
```

See [`IndexinatorIntegrationTest`](jpa-tripwire-test-parent/src/test/java/io/github/jespersm/jpa/tripwire/test/IndexinatorIntegrationTest.java) for a working example.

#### Detection types

| Issue Type | Severity | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Missing FK Index | HIGH/MEDIUM | Foreign key columns without indexes (JPA `@ManyToOne`, owning `@OneToOne`) |
| Missing Unique Index | MEDIUM | `@Column(unique = true)` columns without indexes |
| Missing Declared Index | MEDIUM | `@Table(indexes=...)` declared but not present in schema |
| Missing Query Index | MEDIUM | Columns used in Spring Data derived queries without indexes |
| Potential Composite Index | LOW | Opportunity for composite indexes based on access patterns |

#### Support

Hibernate support is optional, in that a ServiceLoader-based provider (`RequirementMappingResolverProvider`) that maps JPA entity/property requirements to actual table/column names using Hibernate's metamodel API, enabling more accurate schema validation than using the basic introspection based on stock JPA table and schema mappings.

## Development Notes

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Docker (required for Testcontainers in integration tests)

Building and running the tests is just plain Maven.

### Project Structure

This is a multi-module Maven project:

├── indexinator-hibernate/     # Hibernate schema informationprovider extension

```

### Publishing

(just a note to self, I do this so rarely I forget the exact steps)

Publishing is configured in `pom.xml` through a `release` profile that enables `org.sonatype.central:central-publishing-maven-plugin`.

### One-time Maven credentials setup

Add Central Portal credentials to `~/.m2/settings.xml` using the same server id as the POM (`central`):

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>central</id>
      <username>${env.CENTRAL_TOKEN_USER}</username>
      <password>${env.CENTRAL_TOKEN_PASS}</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

### Publish a SNAPSHOT

1. Keep the project version as `*-SNAPSHOT` (for example `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`).
2. Ensure SNAPSHOTs are enabled for your namespace in the Central Portal.
3. Run deploy with the `release` profile:

```zsh
cd jpa_tripwire
./mvnw -Prelease -DskipTests -DskipITs deploy
```

Notes from Central Portal SNAPSHOT docs:
- SNAPSHOT publishing skips the normal Central validation checks.
- SNAPSHOTs are not permanent and can be cleaned up by Central over time.
- If you see `Skipping Central Snapshot Publishing ... at user's request`, remove `-DskipPublishing=true` from your command.

### Publish a release

1. Set a non-snapshot version (for example `1.0.0`).
2. Tag and push the release commit.
3. Run:

```zsh
cd jpa_tripwire
./mvnw -Prelease -DskipTests -DskipITs deploy
```

Test modules (`jpa-tripwire-test-*`) are excluded from the Central bundle via `central-publishing-maven-plugin` `excludeArtifacts` in `pom.xml`.
